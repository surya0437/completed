            It is a great privilege to share my best words forward to my beloved guests. When I recall my younger days,
            I
            see a young man who aspires to serve in the Mera Peak region. As a young man, I worked in mountaineering as
            well
            as the service sector. Those 50 years were full of struggles, but as it is said, there is beauty in the
            struggle; hence I have only beautiful memories of those years. As a humble villager of the Mera Region, I
            consider myself lucky to get an opportunity to serve in my region. I, along with my family members,
            established
            Hotel Mountain View in 2007. Nepal is the embodiment of diverse cultures, traditions, and ethnic groups.
            From
            dense wildlife to the magnificence of the landscapes, our country is undoubtedly astonishing. We welcome you
            to
            our wonderful nation to explore it and take back beautiful memories.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-5">Thank You</p>
